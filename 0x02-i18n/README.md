This library differs from the documented Python API for tzinfo implementations; if you want to create local wallclock times you need to use the localize() method documented in this document. In addition, if you perform date arithmetic on local times that cross DST boundaries, the result may be in an incorrect timezone (ie. subtract 1 minute from 2002-10-27 1:00 EST and you get 2002-10-27 0:59 EST instead of the correct 2002-10-27 1:59 EDT). A normalize() method is provided to correct this. Unfortunately these issues cannot be resolved without modifying the Python datetime implementation
